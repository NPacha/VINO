## Concept:

VINO is a simple app that allows you to search for a wine, and save it to your favorites to reference for later. Born out of too many wine bottle pictures on my phone of which I saved to keep track of new wines that I try and like, I thought itt would be useful to have one place to store them all. 

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* SCSS
* JavaScript 
* React
* Mongoose/MongoDB
* Node

## Approach:

#### Overview
To start the project, I began by sketching out bare boned wire frames to get a general idea of how the app layout will look. This was followed by jotting down the necessary user stories that I wanted my app to have. 
I began setting up my environment in React to begin coding, starting with creating the front end, followed by connecting my data to established backend database with MongoDB.



#### User stories

As an user I expect to see a search field that allows me to input the wine I want to look up. 

As an user I want to see the wine that I searched for display.

As a user I want to be able to add this wine to my favorites to reference later. 

As a user I want to be able to add my own notes about the wine. 

As a user I want to be able to upload a picture of the bottle of the wine to correspond with the wine I saved to my favorites. 

As a user I want to have my favorite wines categorized by white, red, and rose. 

#### Development Plan 

description of your development plan 

* Development Plan  ONE
* Create wire frame Brainstorm actor and actor actions Brainstorm user stories
* Development Plan  Two
* Psuedo-code functionality
* Development Plan  Three 
* Start creating functionality, incorporate CSS and HTML
* Development Plan  Four
* Deploy and test app and Refactor code

#### MVP

* MVP ONE
* A working full-stack application, built by you, using the MERN stack: Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express and React.
* MVP Two
* At least one model with full CRUD.
* MVP Three 
* Pull from a third party API - either client side with AJAX or server-side with an NPM
* MVP Four
* Use React Router

#### Stretch goals

* Stretch goals ONE
* Include professional css styling
* Stretch goals Two
* Be able to store user data in database
* Stretch goals Three 
* Incorporate login page (not met, tbd in Version 2)
* Stretch goals Four
* Sort wines by red, white, and rose (not met, tbd in Version 2)

## Challenges:

The main challenge that I faced was to get this application to deploy on Heroku. Additionally, to create a professional app with useful feature and great user interface in a short amount of time. One of the other main challenges that I was able to overcome and was proud of, was being able to connect my front end with the backend, and figuring out how to store the data on the backend. 

## Future Versions:

In the future versions of this app, I am excited to incorporate a log in and sign up page, a feature that allows the user to upload their own picture of the wine/the bottle, and categorizing the wines on the favorite page by red, white, and rose.
